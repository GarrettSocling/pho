.SH NAME
\fBpho\fP \- View and annotate multiple images
.SH SYNTAX
.B pho
.RI [ options ]
.RI [ filename [ filename... ]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I pho
displays images, in the formats handled by the
.IR gdk-pixbuf
package, to an X display.
It is intended as a lightweight and fast viewer,
optimized for rapidly going through large numbers of uploaded images.
.PP
.I pho
is entirely keyboard driven,
and allows for interactive rotation and taking of notes on each image.
It resizes after rotations and will always attempt to show
the image as large as possible.  The final rotation reached for
each image will be remembered and printed when the program exits
(for use with a batch image rotation script).
.PP
.I pho
can also remember up to ten lists of images (numbered 0-9) which can
correspond to anything the user wishes, plus a list of images to be
deleted.
\fIpho\fR currently does not actually change any files on disk.
