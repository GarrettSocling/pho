Ideas for improving pho (in no particular order).
If you have more ideas, or want to contribute to the project,
let me know!

Coming in the next release:
- "Keywords mode", assigning keywords to notes fields (for categorizing photos)

Should be relatively easy:

- ? brings up a help screen.

- print out commands to do the rotation via ImageMagick.

Slightly harder:

- Save notes to EXIF.

- Save images at the proper rotation.
  (Should preserve EXIF, though!)

Difficult:

- Left mouse button pans image on screen (if image is larger than screen).
