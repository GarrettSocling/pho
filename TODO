Ideas for improving pho (in no particular order).
If you have more ideas, or want to contribute to the project,
let me know!

QUICK FIXES before releasing 0.9.6-pre1:
- One d toggles Deleted flag, prints at end
- Event handler for info dialog (so you can ctrl-space, etc.) DONE
- Comments field more greppable when printing at end. DONE
- exif fields in info dialog not editable DONE

CURRENT SUSPECTED CRITICAL BUGS:
- Non-presentation mode: rotate horizontal to vertical.
  Displays in left half of window but doesn't resize window.
  (CAN'T REPRO)

- Random gtk error messages on stdout (CAN'T REPRO)

- keyword mode, then f, then f, then /, then rotate:
  doesn't resize window. (CAN'T REPRO)

BUGS WITH KEYWORD MODE:

- shifted (capital) letters are treated like ctrl-
  actually looks like only F and D
  (Should be fixed now)

- Show cursor in text fields in keywords dialog (gtk bug, can't fix)

Regression tests:
- make sure keywords on current image get saved when you quit.

- Info dialog still doesn't init first time (maybe fixed? but find out why)

- with exif rotation, ScaleImage in pho.c is passed inverted monitor sizes
  (width passed as height and vice versa)
  so the keywords mode check doesn't work right. Ick!
  Wouldn't it be better to rotate the image first? Oh, but it's better
  to scale down before rotating (for performance).
  (I think I fixed this.)

HIGH PRIORITY:

- Investigate possible memory leak of PhoImage.filename.
  Check comment (probably not a leak) at the same time.

- On Mac: if the image size isn't changing, and we're not in presentation
  mode, going to the next img doesn't actually draw the next image.
  But only if the image size is bigger than the screen; in /2 mode
  it works fine.

- Finish Keywords mode (see bugs above)

FUTURE FEATURE WORK:

- Parse and write Keywords file

- Change set of working images
  - Question: what does pho print out at the end?
    Everything from the session, probably;
    but with full pathnames, or directory separators then single filenames?

Other ideas for possible future work:

Should be relatively easy:

- ? brings up a help screen.

- print out commands to do the rotation via ImageMagick.

Slightly harder:

- Save notes to EXIF.

- Save images at the proper rotation, preserving EXIF.

- Use libexif
