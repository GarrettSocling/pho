Ideas for improving pho (in no particular order).
If you have more ideas, or want to contribute to the project,
let me know!

Should be relatively easy:

- Go back to the first image (especially from the last-image dialog).

- In fullscreen mode, show image at full screen (no titlebar or frame).

Slightly harder:
- Save notes to EXIF, display current exif.

- Save images at the proper rotation.
  (Should preserve EXIF, though!)

Difficult:

- Left mouse button pans image on screen (if image is larger than screen).
